    <h2>LG TV Types and Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <p><strong>OLED TVs:</strong> LG OLED TVs’ pixels emit their own light, allowing for perfect black, a billion rich colors, and infinite contrast for a viewing experience like no other. LG OLED television sizes range from 42 inches to 97 inches, the largest range of OLED TV sizes on the market.</p>
        <p><strong>QNED TVs:</strong> The difference between OLED and QNED is that QNED pixels can only be dimmed, but OLED pixels can be turned off, creating a contrast between colorful images and deep blacks on your screen. By combining NanoCell and Quantum Dot technology, LG QNED TVs deliver peak brightness levels and boast features like 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision.</p>
        <p><strong>NanoCell TVs:</strong> LG’s proprietary NanoCell technology uses nanoparticles to boost the picture quality of LCD TVs, delivering improved color depth for a richer viewing experience.</p>
        <p><strong>4K UHD TVs:</strong> Watch all of your content upscaled to 4K resolution. Featuring HDR for a cinematic experience, LG 4K TVs deliver rich, vivid pictures – so you can see your favorite sports, movies, and more as they were intended.</p>
        <p><strong>8K TVs:</strong> 8K televisions deliver over 33 million pixels (7680 × 4320) for an unmatched cinematic experience, offering crispness, clarity, and smoothness you won't find in a 4K TV.</p>
    </ul>
